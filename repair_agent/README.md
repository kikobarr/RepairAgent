# üõ†Ô∏è RepairAgent

RepairAgent is an autonomous LLM-based agent designed for automated program repair. For a comprehensive understanding of its workings and development, you can check out our [research paper here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17134).

## üìã I. Requirements

Before you start using RepairAgent, ensure that your system meets the following requirements:

- **Docker**: Version 20.04 or higher. For installation instructions, see the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker).
- **OpenAI Token and Credits**:
  - Create an account on the OpenAI website and purchase credits to use the API.
  - Generate an API token on the same website.
- **Disk Space**: At least 40GB of available disk space on your machine.
- **Internet Access**: Required while running RepairAgent to connect to OpenAI's API.

## ‚öôÔ∏è II. How to Use RepairAgent?

To use RepairAgent, the easiest method is to pull a ready-to-use Docker image from DockerHub. Using the Docker image ensures that RepairAgent is pre-installed, and all you need to do is provide your OpenAI API key.

### üöÄ Steps to Get Started:

### **STEP 1: Pull the Docker Image**

Run the following commands in your terminal to retrieve and start our Docker image:

```bash
# Pull the image from DockerHub
docker pull islemdockerdev/repair-agent:v1

# Run the image inside a container
docker run -itd --name apr-agent islemdockerdev/repair-agent:v1

# Start the container
docker start -i apr-agent
```

### **STEP 2: Attach the Container to VS Code**

- After starting the container, open VS Code and navigate to the **Containers** icon on the left panel. Ensure you have the **Remote Explorer** extension installed.
- Under the **Dev Containers** tab, find the name of the container you just started (e.g., `apr-agent`).
- Attach the container to a new window by clicking the '+' sign to the right of the container name, then navigate to the `workdir` folder in the VS Code window (**the workdir is `/app/AutoGPT`**).
- **Tutorial Reference**: For detailed steps on attaching a Docker container in VS Code, check out this [video tutorial (1min 38 sec)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gUtN5j4QnY&t).

### **STEP 3: Set the OpenAI API Key**

RepairAgent relies on OpenAI's LLMs (like GPT-3.5). To configure it, obtain your OpenAI API key and execute the following command within the Docker container:

```bash
python3.10 set_api_key.py
```

The script will prompt you to paste your API token.

### **STEP 4: Start RepairAgent**

By default, RepairAgent is configured to run on Defects4J bugs. 

- To specify which bugs to run on, create a text file named, for example, `bugs_list`. A sample file exists in the repository and Docker image at the location `experimental_setups/bugs_list`.
  
Once created, execute the following command:

```bash
./run_on_defects4j.sh experimental_setups/bugs_list hyperparameters.json
```

You can open the `hyperparameters.json` file to check its parameters (explained more in the customization section).

#### **4.1 What Happens When You Start RepairAgent?**

- RepairAgent checks out the project with the given bug ID.
- It initiates the autonomous repair process.
- Logs detailing each step performed will be displayed in your terminal.

#### **4.2 Retrieve Repair Logs and History**

RepairAgent saves the output in multiple files.

- The primary logs are located in the folder `experimental_setups/experiment_X`, where `experiment_X` increments automatically with each run of the command `run_on_defects_4j`.

- Within this folder, you may find several subfolders:
  - **logs**: Full chat history (prompts) and command outputs (one file per bug).
  - **plausible_patches**: Any plausible patches generated (one file per bug).
  - **mutations_history**: Suggested fixes derived by mutating prior suggestions (one file per bug).
  - **responses**: Responses from the agent at each cycle (one file per bug).

#### **4.3 Analyze Logs**

Within the `experimental_setups` folder, several scripts are available to post-process the logs:

- **Collect Plausible Patches**:
  Use the script `collect_plausible_patches_files.py` to gather the generated plausible patches across multiple experiments:
  
  ```bash
  python3.10 collect_plausible_patches.py 1 10
  ```
  
- **Get Fully Executed Runs**:
  Utilize `get_list_of_fully_executed.py` to retrieve runs that reached at least 38 out of 40 cycles. This identifies executions that terminated unexpectedly or called the exit function prematurely.

## ‚ú® III. Customize RepairAgent

### 1. Modify `hyperparams.json`

- **Budget Control Strategy**: Defines how the agent views the remaining cycles, suggested fixes, and minimum required fixes:
  - **FULL-TRACK**: Displays full budget information.
  - **NO-TRACK**: Suppresses budget information.
  - **FORCED**: Experimental and buggy‚Äîavoid use.
  
  Example Configuration:
  
  ```json
  "budget_control": {
      "name": "FULL-TRACK",
      "params": {
          "#fixes": 4
      }
  }
  ```

- **Repetition Handling**: Default settings restrict repetitions.
  ```json
  "repetition_handling": "RESTRICT",
  ```

- **Command Limit**: Controls the maximum allowed cycles.
  ```json
  "commands_limit": 40
  ```

- **Request External Fixes**: Experimental feature allowing the request of fixes from another LLM.
  ```json
  "external_fix_strategy": 0,
  ```

### 2. Switch Between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4

In the `run_on_defects4j.sh` file, locate the line:
```bash
./run.sh --ai-settings ai_settings.yaml --gpt3only -c -l 40 -m json_file --experiment-file "$2"
```
- The `--gpt3only` flag enforces GPT-3.5 usage. Removing this flag switches RepairAgent to GPT-4.
- Search the codebase for "gpt-3" and "gpt-4" to update version names accordingly.

### 3. Run RepairAgent on an Arbitrary Project

Documentation for this feature is forthcoming in version 0.7.0. We are working on simplifying this process into a single command for ease of use.

## üîß IV. Our Patches

In our experiments, we utilized RepairAgent on the Defects4J dataset, successfully fixing 164 bugs. You can view:
- The list of fixed bugs [here](./final_list_of_fixed_bugs).
- The implementation details of the patches in [this file](./fixes_implementation).

Note: RepairAgent encountered exceptions due to Middleware errors in 29 bugs, which were not re-run.
